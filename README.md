# medals
Website for medals store.

1. use "cd medals" to get in to level is treehouse:~/workspace/medals$
2. git remote add origin https://tengyuancheng@github.com : to add a new origin for remote usage
3. "ctrl +L " to fresh the terminal interface
4. git push -u origin master  (git push changes the repo without warning)

-----------***************---------------
  -u : stands for upstream, a source of a river lies
  // upstream is a remote repo that is the source of the code in the local repo
  set "-u" means to let git to remember the repo and branch you're about to specify
           and make all future git commands push to that repo and branch by default
 

the following 2 command need to actually specify that default repo and branch
-> repo of origin(which just add by "git remote add origin https://tengyuancheng@github.com"
-> the only branhch we have: master (need more learning about which one in the future)

5. we use a https url for remote repo -> a user name will be prompted
since the password is unavailable : we set a token instead
6. "Branch set up to track remote branch master from origin" due to the "-u" option to the git push command,
    and it means you won't need to specify to repo or branch names from now on.
